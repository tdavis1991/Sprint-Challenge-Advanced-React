- [1] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    The biggest reason I could see using class over function components is because hooks are relatively new in the industry so you will run into class components more often in the field. You also have access to certain methods when using class components.

- [2] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
        componentDidMount() is a method that is invoked when a component is mounted. componentDidUpdate() is a method that is ran everytime the component updates similar to useEffect. componentWillUnmount() is the last phase of a components lifecycle this method can be used for clean up right before the component unmounts. 

- [3] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
        The pupose of custom hooks is to share stateful logic. Just keeping your code DRY.

- [4] Why is it important to test our apps?
        So we have more trust in our code. You also don't have to worry about nearly as many bugs in your code.
